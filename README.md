# SARS-CoV-2 Phenomics Repurposing

This repository accompanies the publication:  
**Morphological cell profiling for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 infection**

We present an image-based drug repurposing approach that combines viral protein immunostaining Cell Painting to identify host-targeting antivirals.

## Repository Contents

- **Analysis code** to calculate the *morphology score* from Cell Painting features  
  - Based on Pearson's correlation and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) distance to uninfected controls.
- **Resulting scores** for 5,275 compounds tested in Vero-E6 cells.
