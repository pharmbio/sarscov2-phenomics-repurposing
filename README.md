# SARS-CoV-2 Phenomics Repurposing

This repository accompanies the manuscript:  
**Morphological cell profiling for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 infection**

We present an image-based drug repurposing approach that combines viral protein immunostaining and Cell Painting to identify host-targeting antivirals.

## Repository Contents

- **Analysis code** to calculate the *morphology score* from Cell Painting features  
  - Derived from Pearson correlation and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) distance to uninfected controls.  

- **Resulting morphology scores**  
  - For 5,275 repurposable compounds tested in Vero-E6 cells.  
  - For 324 hit compounds from the initial screen, tested in doseâ€“response in A549-ACE2 cells.
